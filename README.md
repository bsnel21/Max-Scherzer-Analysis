# Using Data Science in Baseball
In this project, I analyze PITCHf/x data for Max Scherzer's 2016 Cy Young season and his average 2011 season.  By using data science techniques in Python, this project outlines what major things Scherzer changed between the two seasons.  
Research includes: Pitch selection compared to batter stance, count, and inning; change in spin axis, vertical break, and horizontal break; comparing spin rate to velocity; location of pitches hit, swung and missed at, and location by pitch type; and more.
